## **Brief information about yourself**
---
 I have a degree in the construction industry. Now I work as a design engineer. When designing in BIM, TEKLA had to independently create parametric models, structural units, and set up tables.

 So I got interested in programming, it was interesting to study how the program works, what algorithms are prescribed.

 Now I am actively learning English and self-learning programming
